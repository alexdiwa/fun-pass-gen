## Fun Password Generator ##

Github Repo:

### Description ###
The Fun Password Generator (Fun-Pass-Gen) is a terminal app created from Ruby that generates a unique password string based on the user's answers to a given set of questions. The user will be provided with a memorable narrative at the end that will aid them in remembering their password. 


#### Purpose ####

The app's purpose is to generate a memorable and secure password for the user.

#### Stretch Goal ####

If time allows, we aim to add functionality to the app that allows the user to store and retrieve an encrypted version of the password. 

#### Functionality ####

Fun Password Generator starts off by prompting the user to pick a path (path 1 or 2) where the user will then be asked to answer a series of questions. The app will then store and use the answers as basis for creating a unique password comprised of a mix of letters and numbers. The user will also be provided a brief story that will contain with their answers to enable easier memory recall.

#### Instructions for Use ####

1. Download the app to a folder.
2. Open the terminal. Locate the folder where you downloaded the fun-pass-gen.rb file using cd and and type "ruby fun-pass-gen.rb" to run the program.
3. Pick a path and follow the question prompts in the terminal, ensuring no spaces are added to the letters or numbers.
4. A password will then be generated after the user successfully answers all the questions, along with a narrative to assist in memory recall.
