#### Fun Password Generator ####

Github Repo:

### Description ###

## Purpose ##

Our aim is to create a terminal app that generates a memorable and secure password for the user.

## Stretch Goal ##

If time allows, we aim to add functionality to the app that allows the user to store and retrieve an encrypted version of the password. 

## Functionality ##

Our terminal app prompts the user to answer a series of questions. Fun Password Generator takes this information, generates and outputs a secure password between 8 and 12 characters, comprised of letters, numbers, and if requested, special characters (!?-_), as well as a a story (or mnemonic), that makes the password easy for the user to recall.
