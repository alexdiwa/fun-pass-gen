### Description ###
The Fun Password Generator (Fun-Pass-Gen) is a terminal app created from Ruby that generates a unique password string based on the user's answers to a given set of questions. The user will be provided with a memorable narrative at the end that will aid them in remembering their password. 


#### Purpose ####

The app's purpose is to generate a memorable and secure password for the user.

#### Stretch Goal ####

If time allows, we aim to add functionality to the app that allows the user to store and retrieve an encrypted version of the password. Another stretch goal is to have the app highlight in color, the specific letter or number taken from the user's answers in the narrative to further help in recall. 

#### Functionality ####

Fun Password Generator starts off by prompting the user to pick a path (path 1 or 2) where the user will then be asked to answer a series of questions. The app will then store and use the answers as basis for creating a unique password comprised of a mix of letters and numbers. The user will also be provided a brief story that will contain their answers to enable easier memory recall.

#### Instructions for Use ####

1. Download the app to a folder.
2. Open the terminal. Locate the folder where you downloaded the fun-pass-gen.rb file using cd and and type "ruby fun-pass-       gen.rb" to run the program.
3. Pick a path and follow the question prompts in the terminal, ensuring no spaces are added to the letters or numbers.
4. A password will then be generated after the user successfully answers all the questions, along with a narrative to assist in memory recall.

### Design & Planning ###

#### Brainstorming ####

I. Initial process

Our brainstorming process initially involved a discusion of the type of terminal app we wanted to create given the timeline we had of getting it working and fully documented in 2 days. Between creating something more novelty focused vs something functional, we decided we'd like to create something that is usable and can be potentially built on in the future.

We initially considered other ideas such as a yoga dictionary or an meal app. However, due to time constraints and the requirements for extensive databases that these will need, we decided to scrap these. After deciding on a password generator, we 
continued brainstorming in a Trello Board what the potential requirements and features we would need for the app. Examples include, potential memorable phrases and questions for the users and code conditionals to implement. Other subheadings included user stories, and a to do list that would assist us in keeping track of project requirements.

II. Trello and the Sprints

At this point we wanted to work using the agile methodology so instead of building all the structures as our initial inclination, we decided to run sprints instead. For Sprint 1, we decided on just getting the code written and getting the initial concept of the app working. Afterwards, we used Sprint 2 to expand on the scope of Sprint 1 (via adding another branch of choice for the users) finalise the questions and the minute details, along with integrating any learnings found on Sprint 1.

#### Project Plan & Timeline ####

March 4, (Monday) - We were given 2 hours to brainstorm and come up with a concept for a working terminal app that needed to be submitted on Wednesday night and presented on Thursday morning

March 5 (Tuesday) - The first day was spent fleshing out the details of the plan, listing the requirements that needed to get done, working on the structure the app via Trello where we set up a brainstorming board to add our ideas and a separate board for the first sprint that we would update as we went along. The project repo was created in github and local repositories were set up on both users's computers. A working concept of the app was successfully ran and the decision was made to create 2 paths that the user could select in the beginning that would present a different set of questions that would be used to generate their passwords. 

March 6 (Wednesday) - App is finalised and the README documentation updated. Powepoint slides were created and discussed for the following day. Zipped project files were prepared for submission.
