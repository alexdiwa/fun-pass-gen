## Fun Password Generator ##

Github Repo:

### Description ###
The Fun Password Generator (Fun-Pass-Gen) is a terminal app created from Ruby that generates a unique password string based on the user's answers to a given set of questions. The user will be provided with a memorable narrative at the end that will aid them in remembering their password. 


#### Purpose ####

The app's purpose is to generate a memorable and secure password for the user.

#### Stretch Goal ####

If time allows, we aim to add functionality to the app that allows the user to store and retrieve an encrypted version of the password. 

#### Functionality ####

Fun Password Generator starts off by prompting the user to pick a path (path 1 or 2) where the user will then be asked to answer a series of questions. The app will then store and use the answers as basis for creating a unique password comprised of a mix of letters and numbers. The user will also be provided a brief story that will contain their answers to enable easier memory recall.

#### Instructions for Use ####

1. Download the app to a folder.
2. Open the terminal. Locate the folder where you downloaded the fun-pass-gen.rb file using cd and and type "ruby fun-pass-       gen.rb" to run the program.
3. Pick a path and follow the question prompts in the terminal, ensuring no spaces are added to the letters or numbers.
4. A password will then be generated after the user successfully answers all the questions, along with a narrative to assist in memory recall.

### Design & Planning ###

#### Brainstorming ####

I. Initial process

Our brainstorming process initially involved a discusion of the type of terminal app we wanted to create given the timeline we had of getting it working and fully documented in 2 days. Between creating something more novelty focused vs something functional, we decided we'd like to create something that is usable and can be potentially built on in the future.

We initially considered other ideas such as a yoga dictionary or an meal app. However, due to time constraints and the requirements for extensive databases that these will need, we decided to scrap these. After deciding on a password generator, we 
continued brainstorming in a Trello Board what the potential requirements and features we would need for the app. Other subheadings included user stories, and a to do list that would assist us in keeping track of project requirements.

II. Trello and the Sprints
At this point we wanted to work using the agile methodology so instead of building all the structures as our initial inclination, we decided to run sprints instead. For Sprint 1, we decided on just getting the code written and getting the initial concept of the app working. Afterwards, we used Sprint 2 to expand on the scope of Sprint 1, finalise the questions and the minute details, along with integrating any learnings found on Sprint 1.
